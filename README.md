# leaflet-challenge

## Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from our data set based on their longitude and latitude.


- Our data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth will appear darker in color.

- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


- Created a legend that will provide context for our map data.
